title:  "[Music] Setting up amp in amplitube and helix"

Ever though why people "just put" interface gain on 0 and make high gain on their pre-amps, drives? Turns out it is a shortcut, not the most optimal way, which results in uncessary noise. [Many people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKxZkNa2A7o&ab_channel=XergioRMusic) thought so, hell. even big companies thought wrongly. 

thanks to some smart people and [this guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ59h7xfvdI&t=558s&ab_channel=GhostNoteAudio), if you want to set it up perfectly and get _chef's kiss tone_ you need to watch this video and adjust it according to the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bZHaapCiCg4RLIFqTS5KyUUVa4MwaqfxRCYk35Bvdrs/htmlview#gid=0)


[interface change](https://ghostnoteaudio.uk/pages/app-inputgain)

if you use helix and amplitube: 

tldr: change helix input/ add booster b4 amp,  with interface input gain 0 -> if not lazy adjust with increased input gain on interface


so now you are one _big_ step closer to the perfect tone of your artist.

> caution: amplitube is weird and shouldnt change input by their input slide, cuz it changes the tone and might result in clipping, so just add booster before amp, which solves this issue (c) Ren
> also each amp for amplitube has different expected input levels, so you need to adjust it accordingly (there is a [link](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/ultimate-amplitube-5-input-gain-list.2491757/#post-37509654) to the guy who experimented with it and found exact numbers, so just do abit of dyor). but for twin reverb(vibrato) it is +9
