Life is great isnt it?

so lets enjoy it more, spends less time on meaningless things and use phone less. 
In essence, be bored more, to do more.

Love running, but nowadays started doing it less. Need to get a grip and start running again. Watched a guy running 10 miles everyday for a year. crazy, but bold, I like it. So now I run 3 km a day for a month. Will increase as months pass by. Goodbye knees, but steps (literally) closer to 100mile run. 

Hate redacting it into .md so bear with me and this raw format.
